# CPU Utilisation Toolkit
The CPU Utilisation Toolkit is a Mule application intended to collect, aggregate and report on CPU usage statistics for CloudHub deployed Mule applications. 

For more detailed documentation, please see the related [Knowledge Hub article](https://knowledgehub.mulesoft.com/s/article/CPU-Utilisation-Toolkit). 

The framework is not an alternative to the [Metrics Toolkit](https://github.com/mulesoft-catalyst/metrics-toolkit/ "Metrics Toolkit"). Rather it serves a more specific funtion, monitoring CPU usage for each application and providing Business Group, Environment and application level information.

The framework is designed to be extensible and easily allow for adding additional reporting toolsets e.g. Splunk, ELK, Tableau etc. At present, only Anypoint Monitoring reporting has been implemented.
